abstract = {Despite the growing development of tools that can integrate land use and transport, the desired integration is still illusive in daily practice. To address this gap, the current study uses spatial metrics, a set of methods traditionally used for studying changes in the spatial structure of landscapes, which are translated into the domain of transport planning. It examines how spatial metrics can be integrated into “Land Use Transport” strategy-making, and how useful they are according to the practitioners' perceptions. A Light Rail Transit corridor in Granada (Spain) provides the empirical focus of this research. Land use characteristics such as: land use mixing, land use diversity and green areas connectivity were successfully studied using spatial metrics, and they were used to map three “Land Use Transport” strategies: (i) proximity dynamics and non-motorised modes; (ii) modal shift from cars to Light Rail Transit system; (iii) shared spaces between motorised and non-motorised modes. Practitioners perceived that spatial metrics could improve the “Land Use Transport” strategy-making process in comparison with traditional methods used in practice. However, certain shortcomings related to the usability of spatial metrics are also highlighted and discussed. This study concludes with a reflection on research challenges for adapting spatial metrics to transport practice.},

abstract = {We present a Python toolbox for the calculation of zonal landscape metrics. Instead of global calculations focusing on the whole landscape, the proposed ZonalMetrics toolbox allows the calculation of landscape metrics for user-defined zones. Such zones can be defined through regular units (e.g. hexagons, grids) that can be created within the toolbox. In addition, any polygonal set specified by the user (e.g. administrative units) can be used. The implemented set of landscape metrics is specifically selected and valid for calculations within zones. The tool is demonstrated based on a case study for the Warsaw metropolitan area and the possibilities of applying the toolbox for different zonal layers are illustrated. The implementation is based on the Python toolbox introduced in ArcGIS 10.1, offering an easy to use graphical user interface and batch calculation possibilities. The source code is free and open to the community and extendable to specific needs.},

abstract = {Maintaining and restoring landscape connectivity is currently a central concern in ecology and biodiversity conservation, and there is an increasing demand of user-driven tools for integrating connectivity in landscape planning. Here we describe the new Conefor Sensinode 2.2 (CS22) software, which quantifies the importance of habitat patches for maintaining or improving functional landscape connectivity and is conceived as a tool for decision-making support in landscape planning and habitat conservation. CS22 is based on graph structures, which have been suggested to possess the greatest benefit to effort ratio for conservation problems regarding landscape connectivity. CS22 includes new connectivity metrics based on the habitat availability concept, which considers a patch itself as a space where connectivity occurs, integrating in a single measure the connected habitat area existing within the patches with the area made available by the connections between different habitat patches. These new metrics have been shown to present improved properties compared to other existing metrics and are particularly suited to the identification of critical landscape elements for connectivity. CS22 is distributed together with GIS extensions that allow for directly generating the required input files from a GIS layer. CS22 and related documentation can be freely downloaded from the World Wide Web. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Stand-alone programs for calculating landscape structure measures do exist, but these programs do not enable the user to take advantage of GIS facilities for manipulating and analyzing landscape data. Moreover, these programs lack capabilities for analysis with sampling areas of different size (multiscale analysis) and also lack some needed measures of landscape structure (e.g., texture). We have developed the r.le programs for analyzing landscape structure using the GRASS GIS. The programs can be used to calculate over sixty measures of landscape structure (e.g., distance, size, shape, fractal dimension, perimeters, diversity, texture, juxtaposition, edges) within sampling areas of several sizes simultaneously. Also possible are moving window analyses, which enable the production of new maps of the landscape structure within windows of a particular size.

abstract = {This book presents the perspective of three ecologists on the concepts andapplications of landscape ecology, a discipline that has shown expansivegrowth during the past two decades. Although landscape ecology is a multidisciplinarysubject involving components as diverse as economics and sociology, theearth sciences and geography, remote sensing and computer applications, we focushere on what ecologists need to know about landscapes.Landscape ecology served as the integrating theme of our collaborative researchfor nearly 15 years, including a 7-year period during which we worked togetherat Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We became acquainted in January 1986 atthe first annual United States Landscape Ecology symposium held at the Universityof Georgia and organized by Monica Turner and Frank Golley. Landscapeecology was, at that time, a new subject in the United States. The first U.S. workshopon landscape ecology, organized by Paul Risser, Richard Forman, and JimKarr, had occurred less than 3 years prior (Risser et al., 1984). One of us (O'Neill)was a participant in that workshop, and two of us (O'Neill and Gardner) wereresearch scientists in the Environmental Sciences Division of Oak Ridge NationalviLaboratory (ORNL) who had collaborated for several years on many aspects ofecosystem ecology and ecological modeling. Turner had a newly minted Ph.D. andwas continuing as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Georgia,where Frank Golley (also a participant at the 1993 workshop and Turner's Ph.D.advisor) was actively engaging his colleagues in the developing ideas in landscapeecology. The mutual interests shared by Turner, Gardner, and O'Neill, coupledwith the excitement and challenge of working in a newly emerging branch of ecology,led to Turner's move to ORNL in July 1987. The subsequent seven years inwhich we collaborated so closely were among the most exciting times that any ofus have had in our careers. There are times and places at which creativity seemsto be fostered more than others, and that time and place had it. The writing ofthis book was precipitated, in part, by the fact that although we are now locatedat different institutions, we shared the desire to provide a synthesis of the field inwhich we have worked so closely together.As ecologists embraced the challenges of understanding spatial complexity,landscape ecology moved from being a tangential subdiscipline in the early 1980sto one that is now mainstream. Indeed, a landscape approach, or the landscapelevel, is now considered routinely in all types of ecological studies. It is our hopethat this text will provide a synthetic overview of landscape ecology, including itsdevelopment, the methods and techniques that are employed, the major questionsaddressed, and the insights that have been gained. The enclosed CD contains allfigures for this book, including the color images. We hope that this will enhancethe utility of the book, especially for teaching. The companion volume (Gergeland Turner, 2001) provides opportunities for hands-on learning of many of themethods and concepts employed by landscape ecologists. It is our hope that ourbooks might serve to inspire others to embark on landscape ecological studies, forthere is much yet to be learned. As we begin this new century, we look forwardto the many contributions that landscape ecologists will make in the future andto the continued growth of this exciting discipline.},

abstract = {This report describes a program, FRAGSTATS, developed to quantify landscape structure. FRAGSTATS offers a comprehensive choice of landscape metrics and was designed to be as versatile as possible. The program is almost completely automated and thus requires little technical training. Two separate versions of FRAGSTATS exist: one for vector images and one for raster images. The vector version is an Arc/Info AML that accepts Arc/Info polygon coverages. The raster version is a C program that accepts ASCII image files, 8- or 16-bit binary image files, Arc/Info SVF files, Erdas image files, and IDRISI image files. Both versions of FRAGSTATS generate the same array of metrics, including a variety of area metrics, patch density, size and variability metrics, edge metrics, shape metrics, core area metrics, diversity metrics, and contagion and interspersion metrics. The raster version also computes several nearest neighbor metrics. In this report, each metric calculated by FRAGSTATS is described in terms of its ecological application and limitations. Example landscapes are included, and a dis- cussion is provided of each metric as it relates to the sample landscapes. Several important concepts and definitions critical to the assessment of landscape structure are discussed. The appendices include a complete list of algorithms, the units and ranges of each metric, examples of the FRAGSTATS output files, and a users guide describing how to install and run FRAGSTATS.},

Level three, Corine Land Cover (CLC) data between 2005 and 2011 were compared. Official wildfire digital data were obtained from the European Commission for the 2005–2011 period. Results show increasing numbers of LULC changes along the protection gradient: NPs {\textless} PPZs {\textless} SIZs. NPs were, in general, highly stable regarding LULC changes and less affected by wildfires, which suggests high environmental effectiveness of legal and managerial protection afforded to the Spanish NP Network. Three study areas (SAs) were very stable in the analysed period in all their zones: Aig{\"{u}}estortes, Ordesa y Monte Perdido and Caldera de Taburiente. In turn, Teide and Do{\~{n}}ana were the SAs where LULC changes were more abundant. Unsustainable LULC changes concentrate in NPs' peripheral areas, chiefly in their SIZs, with wildfires being the most widespread pressure in the analysed period. Teide's SA outstands due to its environmentally unsustainable recent LULC changes, with urbanisation and wildfires affecting natural and semi-natural areas. Sustainable territorial planning and management practices should prioritise this SA.},

abstract = {In the 1990s, promising results in land-use classification were obtained by kernel-based contextual classification algorithms. Soon, however, it was recognised that kernel-based reclassifiers have important shortcomings and research instead focused on object-based image analysis. This study proposes a solution to two of the most important drawbacks of kernel-based reclassifiers: (1) the use of kernels tends to smooth boundaries between discrete land-use/land-cover parcels, and (2) it is difficult to determine a priori the optimum kernel size of the classifier. The Spatial Reclassification Kernel (SPARK) algorithm has been adapted in order to automatically optimise the kernel size depending on the spatial variation found in the neighbourhood of a pixel to be classified, resulting in the Optimised SPARK (OSPARK) algorithm. The performance of SPARK and OSPARK for land-use classification has been evaluated for the Dublin urban area (Ireland), using a Landsat TM image. The MOLAND land-use map of 1990 was used as a reference. Results show that the use of optimal kernel sizes instead of fixed kernel sizes reduces the omission and commission errors for most land-use classes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Land-use conflicts are a concern for landscape planners, especially in peri-urban areas. Planners need to understand these conflicts better in order to make optimal decisions on land-use allocations and conflict management. Such conflicts, however, are complex entities. A common approach for better understanding complex entities is to categorize them into a limited number of types. This study contributes to this end by presenting a typology of land-use conflicts for a peri-urban area of Switzerland. The primary data source is a content analysis of print media reports on land-use conflicts in a larger geographi- cal area from 2006 to 2009. Information on conflict issues is extracted from the reports, transformed via presence/absence coding, and then further processed using cluster analysis with Jaccard's distance measurement. The results of the cluster analysis are displayed as dendrogram and correlation table. Six meaningful types of peri-urban land-use conflicts are identified, namely ‘Noise pollution', ‘Visual blight', ‘Health hazards', ‘Nature conservation', ‘Preservation of the past' and ‘Changes to the neighborhood'. The conflict types do not exist independent of each other, but are often closely related. Analyzing these relationships reveals that alleged ‘main' issues may not necessarily be the ‘real' issues. These insights are crucial for effect-oriented landscape planning.},

abstract = {Remote sensing technology has great potential for acquisition of detailed and accurate land-use information for management and planning of urban regions. However, the determination of land-use data with high geometric and thematic accuracy is generally limited by the availability of adequate remote sensing data, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, and digital image analysis techniques. This study introduces a methodology using information on image spatial form landscape metrics to describe urban land-use structures and land-cover changes that result from urban growth. The analysis is based on spatial analysis of land-cover structures mapped from digitally classified aerial photographs of the urban region Santa Barbara, CA. Landscape metrics were calculated for segmented areas of homogeneous urban land use to allow a further characterization of the land use of these areas. The results show a useful separation and characterization of three urban land-use types: commercial development, high-density residential, and low-density residential. Several important structural land-cover features were identified for this study. These were: the dominant general land cover (built up or vegetation), the housing density, the mean structure and plot size, and the spatial aggregation of built-up areas. For two test areas in the Santa Barbara region, changes (urban growth) in the urban spatial land-use structure can be described and quantified with landscape metrics. In order to discriminate more accurately between the three land-cover types of interest, the landscape metrics were further refined into what are termed `landscape metric signatures' for the land-use categories. The analysis shows the importance of the spatial measurements as second-order image information that can contribute to more detailed mapping of urban areas and towards a more accurate characterization of spatial urban growth pattern.},

The spatial distribution of the resources and processes that provide ecosystems have also been considered in relation to landscape. Because ecosystem services are provided by different ecological processes, the spatial scales probably also differ; this aspect may be of interest for analyzing the provision flow. In this study, we analyzed the spatial pattern of six services that are important in the study area (in Galicia, NW Spain). We first identified the landscape elements associated with these services, defining them as ecosystem service providers (ESP). To represent the ecosystem, we initially used cartographic information based on land use/land cover (LULC) and then generated two different raster ESP data sets: (i) binary and (ii) greyscale. We then explored the spatial patterns of ESP by lacunarity analysis, which is often used to study fractal elements, and by selecting landscape metrics. The results suggest that the spatial patterns of ecosystem services occur at different scales. We observed a strong relationship between lacunarity values and the different distribution patterns of ESP. Multiscale effects were also associated with changes in lacunarity values. Application of different spatial analysis techniques to study the relationships between landscape structure and service providers should provide a better understanding of service provision and enable evaluation of the ecological integrity of landscapes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urban growth patterns are characteristic of spatial changes that take place in metropolitan areas (MA). They are particularly prominent in more recently formed MAs, such as those in certain locations in Spain, where the structure of the traditional city has undergone sweeping changes. Given the capacity of spatial metrics to characterize landscape structure, these metrics can be a valuable instrument to identify growth patterns in MAs and to evaluate possible urban growth options, based on spatial characteristics.This article focuses on a medium-sized MA (Granada, Spain), and explores the use of spatial metrics to quantify changes in the urban growth patterns reflected in three future scenarios (2020). The scenarios were simulated with a model based on cellular automata, which reproduced three urban growth processes (aggregation, compaction, and dispersion) and four urban growth patterns (aggregated, linear, leapfrogging, and nodal). The scenarios were evaluated with metrics that quantified changes in the spatial characteristics of urban processes. Thus, for example, the NP and AREA{\_}MN allowed us to characterize the decreased aggregation of high-density residential land uses in one scenario (S1) and the linear growth patterns in industrial land uses in another scenario (S2). In this way, spatial metrics were found to be useful for the evaluation of urban planning. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sensitivity of landscape metrics to selection of spatial scale (i.e., resolution or areal extent), land-use categories, and different landscapes has led to unreliable conclusions for practitioners of landscape analysis and modeling. Unlike previous studies that mostly considered such metrics and assessed the effect of each factor separately, our study focuses on the sensitivity of the correlation structure of different sets of landscape metrics as a whole under different situations via principal component analysis (PCA). We used the congruence coefficient (rc) to calculate the changes in factor structures under different situations. We used 16 class-level and 15 landscape-level metrics of 900 village-based and 150 town-based samples that were collected from three regions. Five cell sizes, two land-use classes, and two sets of land-use metrics were also considered. We did not control the cell sizes, sample extent, and different landscapes in the sensitivity analysis to study the interactive relationships between different factors. All factors strongly influence the correlation structure of the landscape metrics, with each factor demonstrating a unique influence. Changing cell size significantly affects the correlation structures in the plain region, especially in croplands and built-up lands. Town-based results show a relatively more stable correlation structure than village-based results (except in land-use categories). Different land-use classes show different responses to changing cell size, sample extent, and sets of landscape metrics in different regions. These results show the great interactive influences of these factors, which have often been overlooked in previous studies. The conclusions drawn from fixed factors may be conditional and inapplicable to other situations. The sensitivity of the correlation structure in diverse regions may improve our understanding of landscape metrics as a whole and can provide further insights into the correlation structure of landscape metrics for land-use management and monitoring.},

abstract = {With the projected global increase of urbanization, pressure on land availability for urban use will increase. In areas where urbanization is not controlled, the concentration of human presence in residential and industrial settings may lead to an alteration of ecosystems patterns and processes. More specifically, urban growth points to an increasing need to continuously assess the urban flood hazard from the urban planning, water resource management and ecosystem management perspectives. The general impacts of urbanization on hydrologic processes and flood behaviour were widely studied and remote sensing has been demonstrated as an essential tool in any environmental and socioeconomic studies of urban areas. But, there is still a need to propose an operational method to map urban objects in complex landscape mainly characterized by different types of urbanization. According to these elements, the scope of the study is defined by three main objectives: to assess which data are most appropriate for a given unit of analysis (e.g. catchment vs. county level); to assess the ability of an object-based approach to classify urban objects (e.g. houses, farms, buildings) at multiple spatial scales; to propose an operational methodology for mapping urban sprawl. In order to validate the argument discussed above, and to test the efficiency of the suggested methodology, a case study of the Touch River catchment in southwest Toulouse (France) has been carried out. Urban objects were extracted at regional and local scales from two SPOT-5 images at 5 m and 10 m spatial resolution using an object-based classification method. Results were validated using ground data. The quality of the urban objects classification decreased within the density of urbanization. Only in areas characterized by spread urbanization, post-treatments are required. Nevertheless, the comparison of the results with an urban database realized using a Computer Assisted Photo-Interpretation method shows a better capacity to delineate urban extent at regional scale and to quantify urban objects at local scale. Information on internal distinction within the urban matrix is not provided. Findings of this study can be used for different applications: to produce detailed map required for the production of hazard assessment maps; to produce input data for hydrological models; to form policies on land-use planning and balanced urbanization by the city development, planning and conservation authorities and flood control agencies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In a previous study, a model of landscape heterogeneity was developed and applied to a spatially structured wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population. That study showed clearly the influence of resource heterogeneity on connectivity levels. The simulation study was based on female movements and used population genetic validation data appropriate for a female study. Most models assume that males and females will exhibit similar patterns, although this has rarely been tested. In the current study we extend the analysis to consider differences between female and male connectivity in the same spatially structured pest system. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were screened on the same samples used previously for mtDNA analysis. The mtDNA data were used to validate female results, and AFLP data were used to validate combined male and female results. Connectivity patterns from the two simulations (female, and combined male and female) connectivity patterns showed no association. However, each was concordant with appropriate validation data, showing highly significant associations between pairwise population connectivity and the genetic data. A relative connectivity metric for the combined simulation was regressed against the mean of pairwise Phi(ST) values, with almost 70{\%} of the variation explained by a linear model. Demonstrating differential effects of habitat heterogeneity on male and female connectivity provides further evidence that spatial resource heterogeneity impacts on connectivity. Understanding differences in population connectivity will allow improved predictions of disease spread, local extinctions and recolonizations. Furthermore, modelling such differences in pest systems will allow management plans to be better targeted, for example by strategically introducing diseases for control purposes into populations which exhibit high male connectivity to aid spread, but low female connectivity to inhibit recolonization potential after control.},

Mean wild boar population densities calculated were 10.6 indi-viduals/km20.8 standard deviation (SD) and 10.0 ind/km2 0.6 SD with both estimators, respectively, and are among the highest reported from Western Europe. Because of the low proportion of marked animals and, to a lesser extent, of technical failures, our estimates showed poor precision, although they displayed similar population trends compared to the culling bag statistics.

abstract = {This paper examines the problem of agricultural land abandonment through knowledge of driving factors. First, we reach out a review of the concept of abandonment in order to define the negative and positive aspects of this process in the landscape. Then we focus on a real case study in the Marina Baja region (SE Spain). Finally, we propose, from a theoretical perspective, the use of a methodology to define the most important variables for studying the abandonment processes in this region. First of all, we performed various analyses using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to create a geodatabase which stores the main factors generally associated with abandonment. The variables considered can be grouped into three groups: environmental (such as climate, soils or relief), socio-economic (such as demographic, accessibility or technology) and those related to cultural practices in the crop (such as irrigation or rain-fed stone walls). Considering over a hundred variables we need to answer two questions: (1) which of the variables are really driving factors in the abandonment process of an agricultural plot? and (2) how important is each of them alone or in combination with others? The authors advocate the use of GIS for the feature creation or management and Data Mining techniques to perform the feature selection. Specifically, we propose the use of a concrete metric, aci (Attribute Correlation Index), to answer the questions raised above.},

Firstly, the Land-Use Pattern Optimization-library is used to maximize the suitability of habitats for target species by optimizing configuration based on the current landscape. Secondly, the systematic conservation planning tool, Marxan is used to identify protected areas based on the estimated species distributions from the optimal landscape configuration. We compared our conservation plan for three target bird species from a highland farm with the conservation plan produced using Marxan alone. Our comparison showed the effectiveness of our approach by selecting a reserve network with higher habitat suitability, better connection, and smaller size after relatively minor landscape modification. The proposed approach advances previous reserve site selection algorithms by considering optimal landscape configuration and potential species distributions for a reserve network design. Our approach yields priority maps to guide the design of a reserve network as well as identify landscape management for conservation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Land-use conflicts are complex disputes that involve heterogeneous parties as well as environmental and social impacts that are often difficult to resolve. The measures and definitions of success in land-use conflict resolution still need further research. We investigated four cases of land-use conflicts in two countries, Switzerland (CH) and Romania (RO): a connection between two ski areas (CH), a ski track in a national park (RO), a residential project in a sensitive natural area (CH) and a residential project in an area with poor urban facilities and planning (RO). We developed a framework to assess the cases, and used it to address the following research questions: 'How successful is the resolution of land-use conflicts in these four cases?' and 'Which factors contribute to success or failure?'. The assessment was based on criteria and subcriteria related to conflict management and conflict-solving conditions. To identify the criteria and subcriteria that contributed most to successful resolution and to rank the cases we used the Analytic Network Process. Our results showed that Switzerland was more successful in the resolution process than Romania due to more emphasis on sustainability and equity. The low scores of the Romanian cases resulted from the poor implementation of spatial plans and poor enforcement of environmental regulations, little interest in environmental protection and a preference for quick economic returns, and little importance attached to public participation in the decision-making process. For conflict-resolution to be successful our findings indicate that it is important to foster not only economic aspects but also long-term ecological benefits and to take into consideration people's needs. This study should help planners as it identifies key elements for the successful resolution of land-use conflicts to achieve the best use of land. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Scale is important to consider when investigating effects of the environment on a species. Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data and landscape metrics derived from aerial photographs were evaluated to determine how relationships of bird abundances with landscape variables changed over a continuous range of 16 spatial scales. We analyzed the average number of birds per stop (1985-1994) for five songbird species (family Cardinalidae) for each of 50 stops on 198 BBS transects throughout six states in the Central Plains, USA. Land along each transect was categorized into six cover types, and landscape metrics of fractal dimension (a measure of shape complexity of habitat patches), edge density, patch density, and percent area were calculated, with principal components used to construct composite environmental variables. Associations of bird abundances and landscape variables changed in accordance with small scale changes. Abundances of three species were correlated with edge density and one with component I, which subsumes initial variables of patch density for urban, closed forest, open forest, and open country. Fractal dimension and component II (summarizing amount of closed forest versus open country) were associated with the most species. Correlation patterns of fractal dimension with northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and painted bunting (Passerina ciris) abundances were similar, with highest correlations at intermediate to small scales, suggesting indirectly that these species thrive in areas where local habitat conditions are most important. Multiscale analysis can provide insight into the spatial scale(s) at which species respond, a topic of intrinsic scientific interest with applied implications for researchers establishing protocols to assess and monitor avian populations.},

However, some metrics are more often used for forested landscapes (e.g., core area metrics). Forest landscape patterns are changing fast due to both natural and human disturbances. Remote sensing offers a rapid method of acquiring up-to-date information over a large geographical area and is therefore widely used as a source of the data needed for pattern assessment and the calculation of landscape metrics. However, to obtain meaningful results, correct preparation of the data is essential. In this chapter, we review the various metrics used to measure forest landscapes for different purposes. We deal with five main issues from the perspective of forest landscape patterns: (1) data preparation before the calculation of metrics (e.g., vector vs. raster data, scale, classification) and the associated uncertainties, (2) measurements of a landscape's configuration and com- position using metrics, (3) interpretation of the results, (4) possible uses of the out- comes, and (5) future perspectives (e.g., 3D and 4D landscape metrics).},

abstract = {The aim of this overview paper is to analyze the use of various landscape metrics and landscape indices for the characterization of landscape structure and various processes at both landscape and ecosystem level. We analyzed the appearance of the terms landscape metrics/indexes/indices in combination with seven main categories in the field of landscape ecology [1) use/selection and misuse of metrics, 2) biodiversity and habitat analysis; 3) water quality; 4) evaluation of the landscape pattern and its change; 5) urban landscape pattern, road network; 6) aesthetics of landscape; 7) management, planning and monitoring] in the titles, abstracts and/or key words of research papers published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals indexed by the Institute of Science Information (ISI) Web of Science (WoS) from 1994 to October 2008. Most of the landscape metrics and indices are used concerning biodiversity and habitat analysis, and also the evaluation of landscape pattern and its change (up to 25 articles per year). There are only a few articles on the relationships of landscape metrics/indices/indexes to social aspects and landscape perception.},

abstract = {As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

abstract = {Landscape metrics are used in a wide range of environmental studies such as land use change and land degradation studies, soil erosion and run-off predictions, management of hunting communities, and strategic planning for environmental management, to name just a few. Due to their utility for a variety of applications, there are many indices and software packages that have been designed to provide calcu- lations and analysis of landscape structure patterns in categorical maps. With the purpose of making a comparison between the most used tools (Fragstats, V-Late, PA4.), this paper examines their advantages and disadvantages in order to create a list of common features that need to be incorporated into this type of software. An Application Programming Interface (API) is produced without limitations on data input, that is capable of calculating vector or raster metrics and is extensible. This API should make it possible not only to build third party applications easily, but also make it possible to add new metrics and research into new paradigms related to traditional landscape metrics. Land-metrics DIY (Do It Yourself) is the library presented in this paper. It can calculate almost 40 landscape metrics from geometry provided by an ESRI Shapefile.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the use of the Urban Atlas land use dataset for estimating spatial metrics to analyse the form of urban areas. Using a cartographic generalization process the original Urban Atlas data are transformed by merging neighboring patches of the same land use class to a single patch thus forming larger land use patches. The resulting database is used for estimating spatial metrics and fractal dimension of nine Greek cities at the class and landscape level. Metrics estimated with this procedure reflect the land use distribution and sidestep the problem introduced by the high resolution of Urban Atlas data in which every land use patch is a city block. The metrics are used to analyze the form of the various cities and pinpoint differences and similarities among them. The results demonstrate that with spatial metrics and particularly with class metrics, it is possible to quantify the spatial heterogeneity and fragmentation of urbanization patterns, as well as, the structure and composition of land uses, thus obtaining insight on the main morphological characteristics of each city.},

After considering the scientific implications of non-reproducible methods, we provide a review of both open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and openly available data, before describing an integrated model for Open GISc. We conclude with a critical review of this embryonic paradigm, with directions for future development in supporting spatial data infrastructure.},

abstract = {This paper describes the EAGLE concept, an object-oriented data model for land moni- toring. It highlights the background situation in the field of land monitoring, identifies the team in- volved, explains the technical and strategic considerations behind the concept, describes the cur- rent status of the harmonization and the developments made and outlines the future activities and requirements. After the structure and the content of the data model and matrix are explained, ex- amples are given on how to use the matrix. Besides its possible function as a semantic translation tool between different classification systems, it also can help to analyze class definitions to find semantic gaps, overlaps and inconsistencies and can serve as data model for new mapping initia- tives. On the long-term, the EAGLE concept aims at sketching a vision of a future integrated and harmonized European land monitoring system, which is designed to store all kinds of environmen- tally relevant information on the Earth´s surface, coming from both national and European data sources. Being still in the state of development, some first applications and test cases are under way. This paper also dedicates a chapter referring to the context between the concept and remote sensing in general as well as the relation between land monitoring and the principles of the Euro- pean Commission´s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme.

@article{NavarroCarrion2016,
abstract = {Land cover (LC) is a scientific landscape classification based on physical properties of earth materials. This information is usually retrieved through remote sensing techniques (e.g. forest cover, urban, clay content, among others). In contrast, Land use (LU) is defined from an anthropocentric point of view. It describes how a specific area is used (e.g. it is usual to indicate whether a territory supports an intensive, extensive use or it is unused). Both geospatial layers are essential inputs in many socio-economic and environmental studies. The INSPIRE directive provides technical data specifications for harmonization and sharing of voluminous LU/ LC datasets across all countries of the EU. The INSPIRE initiative proposes Object-Oriented Modelling as a data modelling methodology. However, the most used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are built upon relational databases. This may jeopardize LU/LC data usability, since GIS practitioners will eventually face the object-relational impedance mismatch. In this paper, the authors introduce the SIOSE database (Spanish Land Cover and Land Use Information System), which was the first implementation of an object-oriented land cover and Land-use datamodel, in line with the recommendation of the INSPIRE Directive, separating both themes. SIOSE data can be downloaded as relational database files, where information describing each single LU/LC object is divided among several related tables, so database queries can be complex and time consuming. The authors show these technical complexities through a computational experience, comparing SQL and NoSQL databases for querying spatial data downloaded from SIOSE. Finally, the authors conclude that NoSQL geoda- tabases deserve to be further explored because they could scale for LU/LC data, both horizontally and vertically, better than relational geodatabases, improving usability and making the most of the EU harmonization efforts.},
