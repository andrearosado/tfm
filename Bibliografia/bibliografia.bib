abstract = {Landscape metrics are used in a wide range of environmental studies such as land use change and land degradation studies, soil erosion and run-off predictions, management of hunting communities, and strategic planning for environmental management, to name just a few. Due to their utility for a variety of applications, there are many indices and software packages that have been designed to provide calculations and analysis of landscape structure patterns in categorical maps. With the purpose of making a comparison between the most used tools (Fragstats, V-Late, PA4...), this paper examines their advantages and disadvantages in order to create a list of common features that need to be incorporated into this type of software. An Application Programming Interface (API) is produced without limitations on data input, that is capable of calculating vector or raster metrics and is extensible. This API should make it possible not only to build third party applications easily, but also make it possible to add new metrics and research into new paradigms related to traditional landscape metrics. Land-metrics DIY (DoIt Yourself) is the library presented in this paper. It can calculate almost 40 landscape metrics from geometry provided by an ESRI Shapefile. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

abstract = {The article introduces a conceptual approach for how to enhance the assessment of ecosystem services with regard to landscape structural aspects. Therefore, we have implemented landscape metrics in the cellular automaton based software "Pimp Your Landscape". Using the example of the service "ecological functioning", we tested the potential of our approach to improve the understanding of how landscape structure contributes to the provision of ecosystem services. As a test case, we simulated different afforestation scenarios in a model region in North-Eastern Germany. A major finding for landscape planning was that, without the inclusion of landscape metrics, the actual potential of our poorly structured model region with a large proportion of agricultural areas would be overestimated. In contrast, the benefits gained from afforestation strategies, which aim at improving aspects such as biotope connectivity at the landscape level, would become less obvious. We conclude that our approach can contribute to a more realistic appraisal of the potential for landscapes to provide ecosystem services beyond the contribution of single ecosystem services or - in our case - land cover classes. We therefore plan to expand our approach to other ecosystem services as well, where landscape structural aspects, such as cultural services (for aesthetic value), are essential. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The assessment of cultural ecosystem services, in our case landscape aesthetics, is the most commonly investigated but least formalized issue in the scope of the ecosystem services concept. In contrast to ecological or economic aspects, the assessment of aesthetics cannot easily be based on quantitative information. Therefore, two different methodological approaches that assess landscape aesthetics either from an objective or a subjective point of view have been established in the past. This article presents in its first part an objective, landscape metrics-based assessment approach. We defined naturalness and landscape diversity as assessment criteria and selected Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI), Shape Index (SHAPE) and Patch Density (PD) as indicators. We tested our approach for a set of nine different landscape types in a model region in Saxony, Germany. For validating the developed methodology, we carried out a survey with 153 participants in order to investigate their subjective preferences for the different landscape types. These preferences had to be expressed by rating the landscape types on a scale from 1 (very ugly) to 5 (very beautiful). The study was based on three different data sets, namely photographs of the landscape types, satellite images, and land cover maps. Statistical tests were applied (a) to investigate the impact of personal factors on the ratings, (b) to detect whether abstraction levels are suitable for preference studies, and (c) to compare the results of the objective approach (landscape metrics) and the subjective approach (visual assessment). Personal factors did not influence the visual assessment results significantly. We found the highest correlation of the landscape metrics-based assessment with the visual assessment results of the photographs. We conclude that the three landscape metrics might be applied to the monitoring of landscape aesthetics. An extended study with more participants might be useful to further investigate the reliability of our findings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sensitivity of landscape metrics to selection of spatial scale (i.e., resolution or areal extent), land-use categories, and different landscapes has led to unreliable conclusions for practitioners of landscape analysis and modeling. Unlike previous studies that mostly considered such metrics and assessed the effect of each factor separately, our study focuses on the sensitivity of the correlation structure of different sets of landscape metrics as a whole under different situations via principal component analysis (PCA). We used the congruence coefficient (rc) to calculate the changes in factor structures under different situations. We used 16 class-level and 15 landscape-level metrics of 900 village-based and 150 town-based samples that were collected from three regions. Five cell sizes, two land-use classes, and two sets of land-use metrics were also considered. We did not control the cell sizes, sample extent, and different landscapes in the sensitivity analysis to study the interactive relationships between different factors. All factors strongly influence the correlation structure of the landscape metrics, with each factor demonstrating a unique influence. Changing cell size significantly affects the correlation structures in the plain region, especially in croplands and built-up lands. Town-based results show a relatively more stable correlation structure than village-based results (except in land-use categories). Different land-use classes show different responses to changing cell size, sample extent, and sets of landscape metrics in different regions. These results show the great interactive influences of these factors, which have often been overlooked in previous studies. The conclusions drawn from fixed factors may be conditional and inapplicable to other situations. The sensitivity of the correlation structure in diverse regions may improve our understanding of landscape metrics as a whole and can provide further insights into the correlation structure of landscape metrics for land-use management and monitoring.},

Stand-alone programs for calculating landscape structure measures do exist, but these programs do not enable the user to take advantage of GIS facilities for manipulating and analyzing landscape data. Moreover, these programs lack capabilities for analysis with sampling areas of different size (multiscale analysis) and also lack some needed measures of landscape structure (e.g., texture). We have developed the r.le programs for analyzing landscape structure using the GRASS GIS. The programs can be used to calculate over sixty measures of landscape structure (e.g., distance, size, shape, fractal dimension, perimeters, diversity, texture, juxtaposition, edges) within sampling areas of several sizes simultaneously. Also possible are moving window analyses, which enable the production of new maps of the landscape structure within windows of a particular size. These new maps can then be used in other analyses with the GIS.},

Specifically, we introduce the background and terms related to the free and open source software movement, then compare eight FOSS desktop GIS with proprietary GIS to analyse their utility for landscape ecology research. We also provide a summary of related landscape analysis FOSS applications, and extensions. Our results indicate that (i) all eight GIS provide the basic GIS functionality needed in landscape ecology, (ii) they all facilitate customisation, and (iii) they all provide good support via forums and email lists. Drawbacks that have been identified are related to the fact that most projects are relatively young. This currently affects the size of their user and developer communities, and their ability to include advanced spatial analysis functions and up-to-date documentation. However, we expect these drawbacks to be addressed over time, as systems mature. In general, we see great potential for the use of free and open source desktop GIS in landscape ecology research and advocate concentrated efforts by the landscape ecology community towards a common, customisable and free research platform. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

This study explored to what extent substantial information of configuration metrics increases from certain easily calculated and extensively used composition metrics and how strongly the effectiveness is influenced by different factors. The effectiveness of 12 landscape configuration metrics from the percentage of landscape (PLAND) of each land-use class and patch density (PD) was evaluated through the coefficient of determination (R2) of multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis of 150 town-based landscape samples from three regions. The different landscape configuration metrics from PLAND and PD presented significantly different perfor- mances in terms of effectiveness [the contagion index and aggregation index possess minimal information, and the effective mesh size (MESH) and area-weighted mean patch fractal dimension possess abundant information]. Further- more, the effectiveness of configuration metrics showed dif- ferent responses to changing cell sizes and different land-use categorization in different regions (interspersion and juxta- position index, patch cohesion index, and MESH exhibited large variations in R2 among the different regions). No single, uniform, consistent characteristic of effectiveness was deter- mined across different factors. This new approach to under- standing the effectiveness of configuration metrics helps clarify landscape metrics and is fundamental to landscape metric assessment.},

Although landscape ecology is a multidisciplinarysubject involving components as diverse as economics and sociology, theearth sciences and geography, remote sensing and computer applications, we focushere on what ecologists need to know about landscapes.Landscape ecology served as the integrating theme of our collaborative researchfor nearly 15 years, including a 7-year period during which we worked togetherat Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We became acquainted in January 1986 atthe first annual United States Landscape Ecology symposium held at the Universityof Georgia and organized by Monica Turner and Frank Golley. Landscapeecology was, at that time, a new subject in the United States. The first U.S. workshopon landscape ecology, organized by Paul Risser, Richard Forman, and JimKarr, had occurred less than 3 years prior (Risser et al., 1984). One of us (O'Neill)was a participant in that workshop, and two of us (O'Neill and Gardner) wereresearch scientists in the Environmental Sciences Division of Oak Ridge NationalviLaboratory (ORNL) who had collaborated for several years on many aspects ofecosystem ecology and ecological modeling. Turner had a newly minted Ph.D. andwas continuing as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Georgia,where Frank Golley (also a participant at the 1993 workshop and Turner's Ph.D.advisor) was actively engaging his colleagues in the developing ideas in landscapeecology. The mutual interests shared by Turner, Gardner, and O'Neill, coupledwith the excitement and challenge of working in a newly emerging branch of ecology,led to Turner's move to ORNL in July 1987. The subsequent seven years inwhich we collaborated so closely were among the most exciting times that any ofus have had in our careers. There are times and places at which creativity seemsto be fostered more than others, and that time and place had it. The writing ofthis book was precipitated, in part, by the fact that although we are now locatedat different institutions, we shared the desire to provide a synthesis of the field inwhich we have worked so closely together.As ecologists embraced the challenges of understanding spatial complexity,landscape ecology moved from being a tangential subdiscipline in the early 1980sto one that is now mainstream. Indeed, a landscape approach, or the landscapelevel, is now considered routinely in all types of ecological studies. It is our hopethat this text will provide a synthetic overview of landscape ecology, including itsdevelopment, the methods and techniques that are employed, the major questionsaddressed, and the insights that have been gained. The enclosed CD contains allfigures for this book, including the color images. We hope that this will enhancethe utility of the book, especially for teaching. The companion volume (Gergeland Turner, 2001) provides opportunities for hands-on learning of many of themethods and concepts employed by landscape ecologists. It is our hope that ourbooks might serve to inspire others to embark on landscape ecological studies, forthere is much yet to be learned. As we begin this new century, we look forwardto the many contributions that landscape ecologists will make in the future andto the continued growth of this exciting discipline.},

abstract = {The quantification of landscape structures from remote-sensing products is an important part of many analyses in landscape ecology studies. This paper introduces a new free and open-source tool for conducting landscape ecology analysis. LecoS is able to compute a variety of basic and advanced landscape metrics in an automatized way. The calculation can furthermore be partitioned by iterating through an optional provided polygon layer. The new tool is integrated into the QGIS processing framework and can thus be used as a stand-alone tool or within bigger complex models. For illustration a potential case-study is presented, which tries to quantify pollinator responses on landscape derived metrics at various scales.},

abstract = {Maintaining and restoring landscape connectivity is currently a central concern in ecology and biodiversity conservation, and there is an increasing demand of user-driven tools for integrating connectivity in landscape planning. Here we describe the new Conefor Sensinode 2.2 (CS22) software, which quantifies the importance of habitat patches for maintaining or improving functional landscape connectivity and is conceived as a tool for decision-making support in landscape planning and habitat conservation. CS22 is based on graph structures, which have been suggested to possess the greatest benefit to effort ratio for conservation problems regarding landscape connectivity. CS22 includes new connectivity metrics based on the habitat availability concept, which considers a patch itself as a space where connectivity occurs, integrating in a single measure the connected habitat area existing within the patches with the area made available by the connections between different habitat patches. These new metrics have been shown to present improved properties compared to other existing metrics and are particularly suited to the identification of critical landscape elements for connectivity. CS22 is distributed together with GIS extensions that allow for directly generating the required input files from a GIS layer. CS22 and related documentation can be freely downloaded from the World Wide Web. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Land cover (LC) is a scientific landscape classification based on physical properties of earth materials. This information is usually retrieved through remote sensing techniques (e.g. forest cover, urban, clay content, among others). In contrast, Land use (LU) is defined from an anthropocentric point of view. It describes how a specific area is used (e.g. it is usual to indicate whether a territory supports an intensive, extensive use or it is unused). Both geospatial layers are essential inputs in many socio-economic and environmental studies. The INSPIRE directive provides technical data specifications for harmonization and sharing of voluminous LU/ LC datasets across all countries of the EU. The INSPIRE initiative proposes Object-Oriented Modelling as a data modelling methodology. However, the most used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are built upon relational databases. This may jeopardize LU/LC data usability, since GIS practitioners will eventually face the object-relational impedance mismatch. In this paper, the authors introduce the SIOSE database (Spanish Land Cover and Land Use Information System), which was the first implementation of an object-oriented land cover and Land-use datamodel, in line with the recommendation of the INSPIRE Directive, separating both themes. SIOSE data can be downloaded as relational database files, where information describing each single LU/LC object is divided among several related tables, so database queries can be complex and time consuming. The authors show these technical complexities through a computational experience, comparing SQL and NoSQL databases for querying spatial data downloaded from SIOSE. Finally, the authors conclude that NoSQL geodatabases deserve to be further explored because they could scale for LU/LC data, both horizontally and vertically, better than relational geodatabases, improving usability and making the most of the EU harmonization efforts.},
