\begin{abstract}
Landscape metrics are used to analyzed the structure and behavior of the landscape as well as the temporary modifications, either by natural or human factors. Given the utility for a variety of applications, there are many softwares designed to offer calculations and analysis of landscape patterns. The main objective of this work is to create a reproducible and extensible PostgreSQL/PostGIS exxtension capable of calculating landscape metrics for vector input data. Later, this extension should make it possible to add new metrics and investigate new studies related to landscape structure. Finally, the implementation of the extension is valued because it requires a collaborative work methodology based on a series of tools for containerization and orchestration.


\textbf{Key words}: landscape metrics, extension, reproducibility, containerization, orchestration.
